# TO-DO-List
### Project Report Summary: To-Do List Web Application

#### **Project Overview**
The To-Do List web application allows users to manage their tasks by adding, marking as complete, editing, and deleting them. The app utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a simple, interactive, and user-friendly experience. The main objective of this project was to create an efficient tool for task management and to demonstrate the integration of web development technologies.

#### **Technologies Used**
- **HTML**: The structure of the web page, including elements like buttons, input fields, and lists.
- **CSS**: Styling for the web page, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. Used for layout, colors, and positioning.
- **JavaScript**: The dynamic functionality of the app, such as adding tasks, deleting tasks, editing tasks, and marking them as completed. It also allows storing tasks in the browser's local storage to persist them across page reloads.

#### **Features**
1. **Add New Tasks**: Users can type in a task description and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list.
2. **Mark as Complete**: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking a checkbox next to the task. Completed tasks are visually distinguished.
3. **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks by clicking a "Delete" button next to each task.
4. **Edit Tasks**: Users can edit an existing task by clicking an "Edit" button, allowing them to modify the task's description.
5. **Persistence**: Tasks are stored in the browserâ€™s local storage, allowing the list to persist even after the user reloads the page.

#### **Design**
- The design is simple and clean, focusing on user experience. Tasks are displayed in a list format with each item having an associated checkbox, edit, and delete button.
- The input box for adding tasks is located at the top, and the task list appears below it.
- Task items change visually when marked as complete, with a line-through effect to indicate completion.
  
#### **Implementation Steps**
1. **HTML Structure**: Created the basic structure of the webpage with a form for input, a task list container, and a button to add tasks.
2. **CSS Styling**: Styled the page for a clean layout, including colors, padding, font styles, and hover effects.
3. **JavaScript Functionality**: Added the necessary JavaScript functions for task management:
   - Adding tasks: Capturing the input value and adding a new task to the list.
   - Editing tasks: Enabling an editable input field to change the task description.
   - Deleting tasks: Removing tasks from both the list and local storage.
   - Marking tasks as complete: Toggling a visual indicator for completed tasks.
   - Persisting tasks in local storage: Storing the tasks so they remain after a page refresh.

#### **Challenges Faced**
- Handling task persistence with local storage: Ensuring tasks remain even after the page is reloaded required careful management of JavaScript objects and local storage.
- Task editing: Ensuring that users could seamlessly edit tasks without affecting other functionalities like adding, deleting, or marking tasks as complete.
- Cross-browser compatibility: Ensuring the app worked consistently across different browsers was important for providing a smooth user experience.

#### **Conclusion**
This project successfully implements a basic To-Do List application that provides all essential task management features. It demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building dynamic, interactive web applications. The use of local storage adds a layer of persistence, making the app more practical for real-world use. The project serves as a solid foundation for more advanced features such as prioritization, deadlines, and categorization of tasks in future versions.
